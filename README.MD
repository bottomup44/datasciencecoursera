# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project

## Introduction

This repository is for submitting my course project for "Getting and Cleaning data." 

## Raw Data

Data that is used in this analysis is "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set", which can be downloaded in the following website.

## R script and the transformed dataset

A R script named "run_analysis.R" will do the followings. 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Code Book

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and the transformations performed to clean up the raw data.
